<p><font color="RED"><b>INGEMAR LINDH</b></font>, festival 
conference, Porsgrunn, Norway,
June 5th 1997, upon a question to his preceding speech from a member 
of the audience:- 'You say you want a society were people are 
creative. How about those that does not dare to be creative?': 
</i>
<p>"Not daring to be creative, I doubt.
<p>
Perhaps socially not daring, yes. Of course it is scary to dig
into yourself. To reveal something about yourself. But here immediately
comes in the whole concept of normal, not normal, and normality,
and on the other side, quality. There can't be such a quality
judgement about creativity. But we refer it to that area."

we say - I would do something
creative, and then, at the same time, I judge it - is it good
or bad? Could I be better or not? We place it in a social context.
Whereas when we are really in front of the mystery of creativity,
we don't have that. At least for a couple of hours.
<p>When the baby
is born it is not immediately: 'Oh! A fireman!' 'No, I think a
bank director.' It's just the marvel of the thing itself.
And there is no speculation: 'Will it feed me when I get old?'
 It's not there, there's no speculation.
<p>
Nor in front - if you're not selling flowers - in front of an
orchid. You don't try to take it home to do the washing up with it.
Because you will discover that how efficient it was on you, it
will be totally useless here. In front of the marvel of the phenomena
itself, we don't have any speculation, and we should not with
creativity either."

<p><font color="RED"><b>"THIS</b></font>
goes very far, because there is in creativity a kind
of necessity that is probably, or perhaps, organic, natural, and
indispensable. And that is representation. What we today call
a theatre piece is representation in many languages, Latin
languages, in Italian <i>representatione</i> and so forth.
<p>
But it shouldn't matter. 'Mama look!' 'Yeah, you're very nice.'
But not going beyond that.
Because in that act there is creativity, and that we forget about.
<p>There is already this, that you don't judge the baby.
When we speak about the fear of being creative, it's very much
this, that we immediately judge for ourselves or the others. This
should not be. It's not art yet. It's the source of art.
<p>As it's the source for everything else."

<p><font color="RED"><b>"WHAT</b></font>
is fundamental, is that the amount of value is not measurable, 
we can't measure it.
That's for instance why we have so big difficulties with - the first
time, if you are not used to it and working with it - meeting
handicapped people. Because, you say: 'I have two legs,
and you have one. Don't you feel, just a little bit,... Because
I can run fast and you can't get around?' Why? He would use another 
technique I can't tell you.
<p>
We can't measure the joy. Probably you
can have somebody in coma. And you say: 'Poor guy, he can't kiss
a girl any longer.' But we don't know the amount of joy it is
when they change the sheets for him. Because he don't show anything.
He can't communicate. Perhaps for the first time in his life, he 
can be free. And just
feel pleasure. But this we don't know... And all days into this
world would not substitute that moment.
<p>We always have the values
of prestige or... <i>prestanta,</i> what we can produce. He
can't run, he can't think, he can't... But he's breathing. Probably
breathing much healthier than I do, because he's not smoking. Our 
values are always very flat. We can't say this is more than that.
<p>
And the person that is able to do this, perhaps feel the same
joy as Patrick when he meets with Jacqueline. We
can't measure. As knowing is totally personal, pleasure and reward
as a consequence is also that. You can't measure yourself with
the others. Only say is the thing there, or not, that's all."
