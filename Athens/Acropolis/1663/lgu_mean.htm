the point? Why are we here? Is there some thought or 
plan behind this thing we call life, or are we here 
just by unhappy accident? 
At various times in my life I have given this 
subject some thought. At occasions quite much thought, 
to be honest. 
<p>When searching for life's meaning, one has two 
places to look. Inside life, or outside it. Surprisingly 
it is very usual to search outside life, at least in 
religious thinking. Holy men argue that the meaning of 
life is to qualify for some particular afterlife -- 
be it Heaven, escape from the eternal circle of rebirth, 
or Valhall. 
<p>Instructions on how to qualify for the afterlife 
in question come attached with each theory. These 
guidelines usually make me suspicious, though, as the 
society that created them has so much to gain from 
them being followed. One gets the feeling that the 
societies created their religions with impure motives. 
It sought not objective truth, but to uphold a set of 
values.

one observes life itself, however, it becomes 
clear that we only search for its meaning when our lives 
are not working. This may indicate that the meaning of 
life, quite simply, is learning how to make our lives work. 
<p>This empirical approach of studiyng the subtext of life 
to understand its meaning, may also make religious 
sense. *If* there is a Divine Creator, the only work 
we know should mirror his intentions reliably (unless 
the Divine Creator is very nasty,) is the creation itself 
-- Reality as a Whole. 
<p>The next question, then, is: 'How does one make 
life work?'</td></tr>
