a kid I dreamt about becoming a Greek Philosopher. My idol 
was Archimedes, who got great ideas in the bath tub, and 
then ran naked in the streets shouting "Eureka! Eureka!" 
... Even at this young age, though, I knew the dream to be 
impossible. I could perhaps become a Philosopher, and I could 
certainly move to Greece, but in my heart I knew it would 
all be fake. <p>Then I discovered 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000301101122/http://www.geocities.com/">GeoCities</a>, 
with its theme cities. I am now very proud to be able to 
invite you into my Academy here at 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000301101122/http://www.geocities.com/homestead/homedir.html">

me.
