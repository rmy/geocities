first name is Rune, which means 'secret'. 
By nationality I am Norwegian, and that is the reason 
for the charming accent on these pages. 
<p>I was born on a Sunday, more precisely around 
dinner time the 16th of March 1969, and the first 
thing that happened was that I broke my nose. Later 
in life, when people occasionally have accused me 
of being a sceptical nature, this has come in as a 
handy excuse. "Well, what could one expect," I say, 
"with a beginning like that." 
<p>Secretly, though, I am a bit, well,... sceptical, 
about these accusations. Maybe they tell you more 
about the accusers than they do about me? Is it so 
sceptical doubting that the Star Wars movies 
are based on a True Story? Or that Theatre can 
change the world?
<p>Let them decide who have a better mind than I.

In a way my life is
like a badly maintained web-page. Lots of links 
leading nowhere. I have studied business, psychology, 
literature, and now engineering. I have acted a little. 
I have directed and edited a couple of short films on 
video. I have been a freelance writer for quite some time. 
And I am a reasonably good programmer. 
<p>People close to me are a bit worried that I seemingly 
cannot find a direction in life, but not me, I have a plan. 
I will be very famous once I'm dead.
<p>Well, to get a little serious, I am actually 
striving towards a career in interactive film; 
the only field I know where all my areas of competence 
come in handy. So I guess there is some kind of 
direction, after all.
