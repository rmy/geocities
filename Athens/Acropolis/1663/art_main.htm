a frustrated fiddler in several artistic disciplines
I have been forced to spend a lot of time considering
the nature and meaning of art.
'Do we create for ourselves, the audience, or both?', 'What

be useful to society?' These are typical questions that have 
troubled my mind.

weeks earlier. His main topic for the occasion was
the human compulsion for being creative, seen in
contexts of the individual and society."
