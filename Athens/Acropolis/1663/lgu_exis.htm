God exist? This must be one of the most intensely
debated questions in history.
<p>René Descartes, 
who gave the subject much
attention, meditated about the human mind that
it was unable to really invent anything. Even the
most fantastical creatures created by painters were
built of parts from known animals, and even if they
had not been, they still would have been montages 
of known colors.
<p>Descartes concieved God as the sovereign, eternal, infinite,
unchangeable, all-knowing, all-powerful, and universal
Creator of all things outside itself. It would not be
within the powers of the human mind, Descartes claimed, 
for us to create a clear and distinct conception of 
anything like this by ourselves. The conception had 
to have an external cause, and this cause had to be as 
great as the concept it imprinted.
<p>As he in life had not had direct contact with God 
through his senses, Descartes reckoned that the 
conception was put in him at the time of his creation, 
by God himself.

conviction in a sovereign, eternal, infinite,
unchangeable, all-knowing, all-powerful, and universal
Creator rested on his observations about the 
unoriginality of the human imagination, but also 
on his notion that ideas that are
clear and distinct in us must be true.
<p>Descartes sought to prove this notion by saying that
an all-perfect God could not create anything imperfect.
Man's only flaw, Descartes reasoned, was that he was not 
infinite -- neither in knowledge nor anything 
else. As long as man saw this, and restrained himself from 
passing judgement when his concepts were confused and not 
clear, he would always be right in his opinions.
<p>If it was different -- if we could not trust our reason 
when it seemed to us we possessed clear and distinct knowledge, 
it would be because God wilfully deceived us. 
But as deceptiveness is a sign of wickedness and 
imperfection, and God is perfect, this could not be,
Descartes argued.

impressive, the argument suffers from a 
strange logical flaw. On one hand Descartes wanted to 
show that an all-perfect God exists because any idea  
so clear and distinct in him must be true. 
On the other hand he sought to prove that a clear 
and distinct idea must be true because an all-perfect
God would not have created us differently.
<p>In a circular fashion Descartes attempted
to prove two uncertainties by deducting each
from the other.

another approach, Descartes tried to demonstrate
that clear and distinct ideas must be true by referring to
cases where this in fact is so. However, as it is easy to
find examples of the opposite - of clear and distinct
ideas that were later shown untrue - the argument
falls flat. To mention some, one can point to
Democritus' idea that atoms have irregular shapes 
which cause them to entangle, Aristotle's physics, and 
thus, now, Descartes' idea that clear and distinct ideas 
are necessarily true.
<p>Also one doubts Descartes assertions that
his mind of matemathical genius could not invent
a sovereign, eternal, infinite, unchangeable, all-knowing, 
all-powerful, and universal Creator by combining 
well known principles from matemathics and everyday life.
And even if his assertations were true, it still is
possible that the conception was put in him
by a more imaginative demonic deciever.
<p>By this it is not proven that Descartes' God does not
exist. But neither did Descartes, as was his belief,
prove the existence of an all-perfect God.
