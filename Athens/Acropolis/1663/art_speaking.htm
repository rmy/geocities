couple of months ago a friend and former work partner of mine
paid a visit. For some reason we began to talk about writing
"You seem always to be able to create the feeling and
atmosphere that you want in what you write," he generously told
me. "I have written a lot lately, about things I feel very
intensely about, but it seems to me that I cannot convey my
emotions to the reader."
<p>As we discussed this for a while, his problem became clear
to me. He tried to convey feelings by saying he was angry, or 
sad, or happy.

everyday life people are preoccupied with how they shall relate
to their surroundings. Their reaction patterns are developed
as answers to challenges in their existence. They find a way
of reacting to angry people, a way of reacting to happy people,
a way of reacting to cold people. Throughout life they build
an entire library of reaction patterns; one reaction for every
type of situation they have been forced to tackle.
<p>But the reaction pattern for angry people is not triggered
when someone say to you: "Angry!". It is triggered when you are 
face to face with an angry person.
<p>If you want your reader to feel the presence of angry people,
it is not enough to say "There are angry people in the room." 
You have to confont them with these angry people; you have to
recreate the behaviour of angry people in what you write.
<p>Then the reaction pattern of the reader is triggered.

leads us to what I consider one of the central problems for
artists -- and not only writers. Their
job is not just to interpret reality, as is natural to us
as social beings. They are to recreate it. And in recreating
it they have to understand how it works -- not just how to
react to it.
<p>It becomes a task of the artist to have an understanding
of the inner laws of reality so they can create a surface
that is believable. The believable surface is needed to 
trigger reader or audience reactions.

may, of course, say that triggering reactions is quite easy.
The spectator only needs to be confronted with key elements
of the situation for that to happen.
<p>Taken one step further, though, one may ponder that as we
are very used to reality, we are good at recognizing what is 
real and what is not. Even beyond what triggers reactions in 
us.
<p>This sense of what is real, we can use to judge our 
understanding of reality. Flaws in the surface of our work,
are signs of flaws in the inner dynamics of it, which are
signs that there is something we have not understood.
<p>Suddenly the artistic work becomes more than a means to
move the reader or specator. It becomes a tool for exploring
the inner laws of reality, and to test out our theories about
it.

we can go the other way.
<p>We can search for the key elements that trigger our 
reactions. We can experiment on how far we can deviate from
reality, and still trigger reactions. We can try to find ways
to trigger stronger reactions than they one get through
exact reconstruction of reality.
<p>Even so, practitioners are still caught by this one basic
truth:
<p>Their most important material for creating reactions in
spectators are the reaction patterns these have developed
in confrontation with their everyday life.
