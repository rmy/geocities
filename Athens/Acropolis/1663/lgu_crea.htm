created the universe, they teach in the elementary
schools of my Christian home country.
<p>'But how?' was the question I asked myself 
as a ten year old. And even more puzzling: 
'If it is true that the universe is infinite, 
where was God before the universe was 
created?' Somewhere else, for sure. But if the 
universe is infinite, where could this 
somewhere else exist?
<p>These were difficult questions for a young 
boy, and several years passed before 
I could make any progress. When the revelation 
eventually came, it was only as an insight
into how the Divine Creator *could* have done it 
-- if he had been a human being, existing 
in a reality like our own.

reality was probably not invented yet.
Cyberspace was still just an obscure word found in a 
book the world at large had not yet heard about. 
I certainly had not. I was just a school youth 
spending most of my spare time programming and 
playing games on my home computer.
<p>Still I dreamt some of the same cybernetic dreams that 
were unavoidably spreading at the time, and which later have 
become mainstream visions. Like: 'What if you could 
get a direct link between a computer and the human
mind?' Wishing to learn a foreign language? Just plug in
the cartridge. The prospect was irresistable to a bored 
school youth.
<p>Then I started dreaming of the great role-playing 
game. Imagine that your brain is not only connected 
to the computer, but that the machine takes
control over all your sensory organs, and perhaps
even cuts you off from your memories. You link
yourself in, and the external world disappears.
Instead you find yourself in a virtual reality,
controlling a virtual body. Everything is 
generated by the computer, but to you it is as real
as life.
<p>See yourself striving to come to terms with your
new virtual body. When you have managed that, you 
begin to move
around, perhaps meeting other people, who have
also linked themselves in, and entered the virtual
world. It seems possible, doesn't it? Technically 
it is just a mulitiplayer role-playing
game. The only thing mystic is the direct link between
mind and machine.
<p>Now imagine that our world -- your present life -- 
is such a game.

scenario is of course not very likely, but the fact that
it is possible is interesting enough in its own right. It answered
my original childhood questions of how one infinite universe
could exist inside another one. Also it greatly widened my
views on what is possible.
<p>Reported phenomena like telekinesis, telepathic contact, even 
teleportation, and divine intervention no longer seemed so 
far-out. Once they could be imagined on a technical level,
they became fathomable. A Creator would have little trouble
including such features if he wanted to.
<p>It also showed me how, as fundamental Christians insist, God 
could design our world in a few days, and in an order not
consistent with the one scientists discover when they study
evolution. Of course, he just ran evolution over and over,
focusing on adding new features each time, until he got it right.
<p>So -- the scenario seemed like bad news for atheism, then. But
actually it was not better for religious dogma. Suddenly just
any creation history seemed possible. Once you can imagine 20 
theories that all seem equally likely, and you have no means
of testing them, you realize that choosing one is a matter of 
mere speculation.
<p>Myself I am an ardent agnostic.
