<p><font color="RED"><b>INGEMAR LINDH</b></font>, festival 
conference, Porsgrunn, Norway,
June 5th 1997, upon a question to his preceding speech from a member 
of the audience:- 'In a discussion you have said an actor cannot 
become another person. But can you use a play to gain understanding 
into another person?': 
</i>
<p>"It's a very long theme, but I'll try to shorten it down
a little bit.
<p>
Of course you can't become another person. And because we accept
- and only if we accept - the impossibility of one level of reality,
we have access to the next level of reality. As long as we get
stuck on one level, we'll never have access to the next. And,
of course, I can't become another person."

it's the question of Hamlet, or any Shakespeare text,
I know that this is a good writer, so I have faith. I see the
truth is already there; everything is written down in those small,
black points. And I don't have to worry about that.
<p>
As an actor, what I can do, is first of all to try to create my
own world, so I have something to meet it with -- the monster
of Shakespeare. I must arm myself in order to be able to meet
it. The most beautiful fights are always between two masters.
Not between a weak and a strong. That's slaughter. And in order
to avoid this slaughter, I have to arm myself, so I have the means
whereby I can meet him, with my instrument, my body.
Then I try to penetrate, as we do in the martial arts.
<p>
You know that you can never <i>be</i> your adversary. But you 
can become one with what is in between. And in that way you can 
understand him, perhaps sometimes even before he does so himself. 
You feel that he will come with his blow, and you block there, and 
you know it before. And then we can come very, very close, so that
my understanding have a marriage with the other ones understanding.
<p>
It is the way my desire of penetrating the other one, or the text,
or the costume, or whatever it is that comes from an outside,
that make it possible. And it's this meeting point that the eventual
public will see. They will not see one or the other, but they
will see them meet. And perhaps sometimes clash.
<p>
Because revelations are not always smooth. Revelations come also
through clashes."

to go a step further an becoming [one with your adversary
is impossible. And even if it was, it would not shed new light].
So the pleonasm of the tautology should be avoided. There should
be this meeting, but with the desire to breath more and more,
in a way, together.
<p>
For that you must have the tools. The tools to create your own
instrument, and the tools to read the other. Read the other in
the sense of the prayer, which means listen. That my instrument,
my gesture, even like this" - does a martial art stance - "is 
not only to protect myself. It's not my harness. It's not my escape 
from the world, but it's my antenna to the world. And when I do this,
I feel my opponent, and therefore I know him better. And he goes
in here. 
<p>
You have to have a good technique, otherwise you can go too far.
And it's the same with the text:
You can be too pretentious. If you put too much of yourself into
Shakespeare, he will vanish, he will not breath any longer. It's
like playing a drum. You touch the drum, but as soon as you have
touched it, you have to let it fly. Otherwise...." Silent beats.
"The 'Boom!' is when you go back. The drum starts to resonate. Not
if you say: <i>'Oh! I want to drum!'</i>" Choking the imaginary 
drum with affectionate beating. "We should not suffocate our 
partners. Not even Shakespeare."
<p>
Jesting: "Not even Desdemona."
<p>
"So you can use the text to understand someone 
other than yourself by investigating a character...?" the female 
in the audience who coined the original question asks.
"But you understand the other one through yourself," 
replies Lindh.
