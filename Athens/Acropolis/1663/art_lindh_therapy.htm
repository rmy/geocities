<p><font color="RED"><b>INGEMAR LINDH</b></font>, festival 
conference, Porsgrunn, Norway,
June 5th 1997, upon a comment on his preceding speech from a member 
of the audience:- 'The extensive need for therapy in society 
is a symptom of lack of opportunities to be creative': 
</i>
<p>"Why do we need therapy?
<p>I think it's quite simple. It's that we have given a name 
to a kind of activity that in fact should be normal. There is 
a very common confusion in our use of language also. As I said 
in the course here today, when we start to transform what is 
a phenomenon, a thing, into a concept, we get lost. And this 
we do very often, and we loose,... and we can't understand 
anything, it's impossible.
<p>What is there? You say communication. Everybody in 
theatre speak about communication. We should work on communication. 
Yeah. Very good.
<p>But what we don't notice is that we already put in 'communication' 
a moral value. Which we means, we say we should work on 
<i>good</i> communication. Because communication is always there. 
Even if I go out now, and lock myself into the toilet, and you 
sit here, we will have a very strong relationship. You will wait 
for me, and I will never come out. It will be very precise 
communication. But we do it to a concept, so we say -- we can also 
value it --  it's a <i>good</i> communication."

<p><font color="RED"><b>"WITH</b></font> 
therapy it's the same thing, and we err when we start to borrow 
terminology from science. Medical science, specifically, have this 
problem that when they come to know a phenomena in a human being, 
it's already pathological. As with a car. You never take the car 
to the mechanic before it breaks down. And when it doesn't work, 
we start to notice that there is something wrong. Before everything 
is fine. Therapy is one of those things. You start to go in therapy, 
or do therapy, when there is something wrong.
<p>If you do it immediately, that life is an exercise, life and 
an exercise <i>is</i> therapy in the sense that I am trying to use that 
specific activity, training, whatever, exercises, in order to 
grow. When the activities we are doing every day loose the function 
of not only producing a product, of being both the product and 
the process, they loose the therapeutic function. And when you 
have too many of those activities that turn out to be, on the 
spiritual level, nonsense, you need to replace them with nonsense 
activity and consider them as valuable.
<p>We know that we can do anything as therapy or spiritual 
exercises. You can sit in a lotus, or you can climb the mountain, 
or you can do art, or tai chi, or whatever. Or knitting. As long 
as your way of seeing it is integrating all the parts. We speak 
very nostalgically about the old society, but perhaps there is 
something true in it. Because the necessity on the first level, 
that the bloody potato should come up, and not down, and they 
already there give me a certain joy.
<p>I can imagine that there are people cultivating potatoes, and 
never eat potatoes. Because the cultivation is already enough. 
And then you eat them, but it's a part of your activity. Because 
when you go there you have to meditate otherwise you become crazy. 
And then you use the time, and the fatigue, as an instrument. 
Because how do I come to meditation? It's to renounce. Not to 
give up, but to give in. Which means to abandon myself. This is 
necessary, so I don't ask any questions.
<p>That is the same with the indispensable. I do it, I abandon 
myself to it, and when it's done, I can reflect. But not before."

<p><font color="RED"><b>"NORMALLY</b></font>, what might be 
wrong with modern therapy, is that you try to reflect before. 
And you have no basis for your reflection, because you haven't 
done anything. And it becomes even more a kind of frustration. 
<p>Our brain is an expert on building up frustrations. It's 
probably the best instrument. Because the brain is not doing 
the thing. It's speculating on the thing. When I say creativity, 
it is therapy, but life therapy. And I think there can be a 
big danger in inventing a substitute. Because we will always 
feel that there is a lack on the other side.
<p>I do this only for therapy, and it has no other meaning, and 
I will loose all the equivalence that we need. That eating bread 
is a spiritual activity. But also because I need bread. And 
because it's good. If it's nice, the sandwich is already feeding 
me. If it smells good, it's already feeding me. Perhaps I'm not 
hungry, but still bread smells good."
