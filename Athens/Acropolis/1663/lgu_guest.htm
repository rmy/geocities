- THE GREAT DEBATE -
'Is Religion Losing its Grip?'
In the second edition of Life and Death, we 
published a transcript of a debate held
in April last year between four experts on religion. 
The furore which this
seemingly innocuous event created was astounding. 
We received hundreds of
letters and phone calls responding to the many 
controversial issues raised. And
even today, twelve months further on, many are still 
arguing heatedly over the
implications of that debate."
