<p><font color="RED"><b>INGEMAR LINDH</b></font>, festival 
conference, Porsgrunn, Norway,
June 5th 1997, upon a comment on his preceding speech from a member 
of the audience:- 'How do you work at the Institute for Scenic Art 
<i>(Institutet för Scenkonst)</i>, and what do you aim at 
with your work?': 
</i>

<p>
"We don't know what we aim at.
<p>
You perhaps know what you don't want, and it's a lot of work
already to eliminate what you don't want. So it's ladders without
steps. And when you discover, you always
discover something that, even if it was unknown, was already latent 
in you.  Because otherwise you would not recognise it. 
Our only possibility of recognising the unknown, is that it has a 
correspondence within us somewhere.
<p>
But how we work is a very long story."

<p><font color="RED"><b>"I</b></font> 
think one general thing is: 'How do I as an actor prepare,
very carefully, to encounter the unknown?' It seems like a contradiction.
I used to take this example of an expedition, where they, a couple
of centuries ago, went to the unknown continent Africa. And they
don't know what they will meet. Neither do any expedition for that sake. 
Going towards where nobody have been before. You can imagine certain
things, you can have the intuition of certain things, you can
inform yourself about certain facts. And you prepare, and you
prepare, and you prepare. And when you come there, it's not at all 
like that. 
<p>But you are
prepared. So you have your reference. You can prepare for the
danger coming from here. As in Malta, they always say that the
Turks will do the invasion. Of course, as they are all there stuck
looking towards Turkey, they will be very surprised when
they come form Africa. So they will not be able to turn around.
<p>
But if you are prepared that some other will attack, then you can
train it here in this direction, but you can also switch. And
this is the only way we can really prepare. Prepare for the
unknown, and listen -- to not get stuck... That you already know
what you will find. Because if you don't find that, you will not
see what you find.
<p>
And then you are as if you were blind."
